Space Nun Run (Unity)

It’s the year 2830. Earth is no longer inhabitable. 
Space is locked down, under complete control of a tyrannical spin off of the catholic church. Humanity consists nearly solely of Nuns in an evil autocracy led by the Pope fueled by the desires of complete  population control 
You are the only one who can make a difference. By exploring space running through, fighting and obliterating armies of nuns, you must figure out what has happened to the human race and if there is any possible way to save it.
